# Unexpected sync.Map Behavior After Deletion in Go

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue with Go's `sync.Map` where deleting a key and subsequently attempting to access it doesn't always return the expected result of `<nil> false` if there was previously a value associated with that key.

The `bug.go` file showcases the problem: a key-value pair is stored, then the key is deleted. Subsequently accessing the key doesn't always show the expected result.  This occurs because `sync.Map` uses a more sophisticated implementation for concurrent operations.

The `bugSolution.go` demonstrates an alternative method that ensures accurate reflection after deletion, which may be preferable for simpler scenarios or when requiring strict consistency after a delete operation.
